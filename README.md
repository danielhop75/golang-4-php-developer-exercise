# golang-4-php-developer-exercise
My own course of golang. 
Emphasis on web and system solutions. 
Especially for those who are coming from php world.
I learn it on my own, so I started from very simple exercises to more complicated.  

Some basic rules:

1. All exercises are describe in README.md file. 
2. each exercise is located in separated folder (there are often more that one file inside).
3. Each exercise name consists of exXXXXX-desc where ex => exercise, XXXXX => number of ex, desc => short description
